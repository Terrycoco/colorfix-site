<p>Hi Yvonne,</p>

<p>
I’ve applied three approved <strong>Higgins Ranch</strong> schemes to your home model so you can see how they read on your elevation.
</p>

<p>
This includes the gray option (Scheme 24) along with two additional approved schemes that offer the strongest contrast within the current list.
</p>

<p>
You can review them here:<br>

<p style="color:#666; font-size:14px; margin-top:10px;">
All examples reflect the HOA’s published color combinations and placements.
</p>

<p>
If helpful, you’re welcome to forward the link to the Architectural Committee for reference.

Best,<br>
